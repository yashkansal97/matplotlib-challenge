### Analysis:

- The mean and median tumor volume is very low compared to other Drugs (except Ramicane) and that indicates that the drug might be useful in reduction of tumor.
- Comparing Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin drug treatments, we see significantly lower means and distribution for Capomulin and Ramicane. This further indicates that these two drugs are working well compared to others. 
- Picking any random mouse treated with Capomulin, the tumor volume always seems to go down. This shows that Capomulin is definitely working to some extent.
- Finally, looking at the average tumor volume vs mouse weight for all mouse treated with Capomulin, it seems the tumor volume is very strongly positively correlated to the weight of the mouse.

### Conclusions:

- Capomulin has positive effect in reducing the tumors in the tested mice, and is potentially a good treatment. However, Ramicane has slightly better results across the board and therefore, Capomulin doesn't necessarily prove to be a better treatment than this specific alternate.
- Since weight and tumor volume are very strongly correlated for mice treated by Capomulin, Capomulin is potentially more effective for mice that weigh less.
